### __Hello everybody!__

Last week was Halloween, so I wanted to share with you a delicious pumpkin pie recipe.

### INGREDIENTS 
   
__Pie Dough__ 

* 1 2/3 Cup Flour 

* 1 tsp Salt 

* 2 Sticks Butter 

* 2-3 Tbsp Ice Water 

__Pie Filling__

* 1 Cup Sugar 

* 1/2 tsp Salt 

* 1 tsp Ground Cinnamon 

* 1/2 tsp Nutmeg 

* 1/2 tsp Ground Ginger 

* 2 Eggs 

* 15 oz Canned Pumpkin Puree see notes 

* 1 1/3 Cup Evaporated Milk see notes 

### INSTRUCTIONS 
  
__Pie Dough__ 

Add the flour and salt to a large mixing bowl. Cut the butter into small cubes and add to the bowl. Use clean dry hands to rub the butter into the flour until it resembles sand and the butter is no larger than the size of a pea. 
Spoon in the ice water and use a butter knife to combine the ingredients together. Pour the pie dough out onto the work top and form into a ball. Cover and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. 
Roll the chilled pie dough out to 1/8" or 1/2 cm thick and place in a 8" or 20cm pie dish. Cut off the excess pastry and using your thumbs and finger pinch the edges of the dough. Place into the fridge until ready to use. 

__Pumpkin Pie Filling__ 

In a clean bowl add the sugar, salt, spices and eggs. Whisk to combine until there are no longer any lumps.Add the pumpkin puree and evaporated milk and whisk until you are left with a smooth and creamy custard 
Remove the pie crust from the fridge and pour in the pumpkin pie filling. Place into a 230C / 450F oven on the bottom rack and immediately turn the the temperature down to 170C / 325F. Bake for about 50 minutes to one hour or until the center of the pie only slightly jiggles when shaken. 
Cool the pie completely at room temperature. Serve with a dollop of freshly whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon. 

### NOTES 

If you are using homemade pumpkin puree, cut a pumpkin in half and bake face down for around 40 minutes at 200C or 400F until soft. Leave to cool before scooping out the flesh and blending. Squeeze out as much moisture as you can by wrapping the pureed pumpkin in a tea towel and squeezing. 
White sugar can be replaced with brown sugar for a more caramel flavour to the pumpkin pie. 
Evaporated milk can be replaced with cream or half and half.
